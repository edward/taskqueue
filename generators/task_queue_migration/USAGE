Description:
    The task_queue migration generator creates a migration for the TaskQueue
    model.

    The generator creates a migration class in db/migrate prefixed by its
    number in the queue of migrations.

Example:
    ./script/generate task_queue_migration

    With 4 existing migrations, this will create an TaskQueueMigration
    migration in the file db/migrate/5_task_queue_migration.rb
